# The end-to-end lab

`swift test` checks uDeck's decisions without a window server. Some things can
only be checked on a real Mac with a real login session — that an update
installs, that the panel opens when the pointer reaches the top edge, that
"Open at Login" survives a reboot — and checking them on the Mac you are working
on means the tests take over your screen. The lab runs them inside throwaway
macOS virtual machines instead, headless, and puts everything back afterwards.

It runs on an Apple Silicon Mac only, and not in GitHub CI: hosted runners do
not offer nested virtualisation.

> **Being built.** What exists today is the command itself — selection,
> pre-flight, outcomes and the report. The virtual machines, the golden image
> and the first checks follow.

## Running it

```sh
e2e/run.sh --list              # what checks exist
e2e/run.sh                     # all of them
e2e/run.sh updates             # one group
e2e/run.sh updates.wrong-key   # one check
e2e/run.sh --guest 26          # on macOS 26 instead of 27
```

You need [Tart](https://tart.run) — exactly the version pinned in
[`udeck_e2e/config.py`](udeck_e2e/config.py) — and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The lab finds `tart` through `$TART`, then
`PATH`, then `~/Applications/tart.app` and `/Applications/tart.app`.

Before starting anything, the pre-flight checks the Tart version, that the host
can run the guest, free disk and memory, and that no other virtual machine is
running — macOS runs at most two macOS guests at once, so a `tart run` from
another Tart home or another user counts too. It stops only the lab's own
orphans: your `tart run udeck-e2e-…` of a clone left behind by a run that died,
identified again by pid and start time right before each signal. A kept clone
or a golden image you opened yourself is never stopped; the run refuses to start
until you close it. Nothing else is touched, and the lab does not keep your Mac
awake: if the Mac sleeps during a run, the run is interrupted.

Only one run at a time for your user on this Mac, whichever checkout or
worktree it starts from: the lock is `~/Library/Caches/udeck-e2e/lab.lock`.

## Reading the result

One line per check, then a summary:

```
✅ updates.sparkle  2m14s
❌ updates.wrong-key  1m02s — Sparkle installed an update signed with the wrong key
   evidence: .build/e2e/20260916-172233/updates.wrong-key/
⚠️ panel.push  0m40s — could not check: waiting for SSH after the reboot: no answer in 240s
1 passed, 1 failed, 1 could not check in 3m56s
```

There are three outcomes, and they are kept apart on purpose:

| | means | exit code |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ passed | uDeck did what the check expected | 0 when every check passed |
| ❌ failed | uDeck did not — this is evidence about uDeck | 1 if any check failed |
| ⚠️ could not check | the lab could not carry the check out — a machine that did not boot, SSH that never answered — and says nothing either way about uDeck | 2 otherwise |

A run that checked nothing exits 2, never 0. So does a run where every check
passed but a clone could not be cleaned up.

Each run leaves `.build/e2e/<run>/`, named by its start in UTC: `ledger.jsonl`,
one JSON line per event written as it happens — including every signal the
pre-flight sends, before it sends it — and a directory per check with what it
collected. The last ten runs that checked something are kept, and separately the
last ten the pre-flight refused, so retrying a refused run cannot delete the
evidence of a real one.

Ctrl-C stops the run and still cleans up: the interrupted check's machine is
torn down while the lock is held, a verdict the check had already reached stands,
and anything unfinished counts as "could not check".

## Writing a check

A check is a function named `check_<name>` in `checks/check_<group>.py`, and is
called `<group>.<name>` on the command line — `check_wrong_key` in
`check_updates.py` is `updates.wrong-key`.

* Say that uDeck failed with `expect(condition, message)` from
  `udeck_e2e.errors`, or a plain `assert` in the check itself.
* When the lab cannot do something it needs — rather than uDeck getting it
  wrong — raise `LabError(step, reason)`. Any other exception, and any `assert`
  outside a check file, is also treated as the lab failing, never as uDeck
  failing.
* The `check_dir` fixture is the check's own directory in the run's report.
* Check files live directly in `checks/`, and a file must not skip itself — a
  skipped file would silently drop its whole group. An exception in a thread the
  check started makes the check "could not check".

## The lab's own tests

```sh
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.build/e2e/venv uv run --frozen --project e2e pytest e2e/tests
```

They need neither Tart nor a virtual machine.
